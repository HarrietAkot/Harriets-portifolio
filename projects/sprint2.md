## What it does

RecycleThis is a mobile game for kids to teach them about recycling.
The goal of the player is to correctly sort as many items as possible in 1 minute. If you put an item in the wrong bin, you lose points.

## What we learned
Building a game in React Native can be challenging (and not always recommended ðŸ˜…), but since our game is pretty simple and doesn't require a lot of physics, we thought it would be interesting to try and develop one. Nobody in our group has ever built a game, so it was a nice learning experience!
Most of us weren't familiar with React Native and mobile development in general. It was a nice surprise to see how easy and fun it is to develop a React Native app, especially using Expo. We recommend Expo to anyone who is curious about mobile development, as it is very beginner friendly.
Challenges

## What's next?
adding sound effects!
implementing a global leaderboard rather than local (add database)
adding a nicer landscape for the game's screen (mountains))
adding multiple player / competition mode
publishing / deploying âœ¨!
